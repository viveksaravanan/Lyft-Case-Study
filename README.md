# Lyft Case Study in Toledo, Ohio

This is a case study where I assumed the role of a pricing product manager at Lyft. The objective was to analyze and optimize pricing strategies for Lyft's ride-scheduling feature in a new city. Further details can be found below.

In this scenario, you are the pricing product manager for Lyft's ride-scheduling feature, and you are launching in a new city, Toledo, Ohio. The prevailing rate for rides from the airport to downtown is $25, with drivers earning $19 per ride. However, only 60 out of every 100 ride requests are finding a driver at this price.

Currently, the unit economics are as follows:

Drivers:
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) for a new driver is between $400 - $600.
- Drivers experience a 5% monthly churn rate and complete 100 rides per month.

Riders:
- CAC for a new rider is $10 to $20.
- Each rider requests 1 ride per month on average.
- Riders who don't experience a "failed to find driver" event churn at a rate of 10% per month, while those who do churn at 33% per month.

Based on a previous pricing experiment, lowering Lyft's take from $6/ride to $3/ride increased match rates from 60% to approximately 93%.

Your task is to maximize net revenue for the next 12 months on this route in Toledo. You cannot charge riders more than the prevailing rate. The core question is how much more or less Lyft should pay drivers per trip (by changing Lyft's take) in order to achieve this goal.

To maximize net revenue, you need to consider adjusting Lyft's take rate. By reducing Lyft's take from $6 to $3 per ride, the match rates increased significantly. Therefore, it would be reasonable to explore further reductions in Lyft's take rate.

By lowering Lyft's take rate, more drivers are likely to accept ride requests, increasing the match rate. This, in turn, reduces the number of "failed to find driver" events and lowers rider churn. By analyzing the trade-off between Lyft's take rate, driver earnings, rider acquisition costs, and churn rates, you can find the optimal balance that maximizes net revenue for the next 12 months on this route in Toledo.
